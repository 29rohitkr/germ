## Today’s git operation



It is assumed that you have already setup your github username and email, if not [visit here](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/setting-your-username-in-git)



### Note

Here, `username` is your friends user-id.

`reponame` is your friend’s repository



### Steps

```bash


$ git clone https://gihub.com/username/reponame.git

$ git checkout -b myNewBranchName

# make your changes

$ git add .

$ git commit -m "Short Commit message"

$ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/myUsername/reponame.git
# 'reponame' should be the same

$ git push origin myNewBranchName

```

#### Merging

Go to the your github repo (here, ‘reponame’) and issue a pull request to `username/master` for merge.



#### To delete the branch you created

```bash
 $ git branch -d myNewBranchName
 
 $ git push
 
 $ git pull

```
