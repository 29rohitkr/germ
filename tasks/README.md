# Tasks

This folder contains basic tasks that team members have to perform from time to time to testify and enhance their learning.

#### Workflow

* Your task will be specified in a text file within the respective task folders.
* Submissions for a task must be done inside a folder having your github handle as its name (E.g. `mountAP`) and this folder must reside inside the sub-folder named `submission` which in turn resides inside the task folder (E.g. `task2-randomNumber`) of the task for which it is being submitted.
